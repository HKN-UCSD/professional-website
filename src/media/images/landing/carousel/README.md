# Carousel Images

Simply place your carousel images in this directory and they will be automatically detected and used in the carousel!

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, or WebP
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 recommended
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading

## Usage:
The carousel will **automatically** detect and cycle through all image files in this directory. No code changes needed!

Just drop your images here with any filename you like:
- `hero-image.jpg`
- `campus-photo.png`
- `team-picture.webp`
- `event-photo.jpeg`
- etc.

## Supported Formats:
- `.jpg` and `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

The images will be automatically blurred and have a slight overlay to ensure the text remains readable. The carousel will cycle through them every 5 seconds with smooth fade transitions.
